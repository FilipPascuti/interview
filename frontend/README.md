# Pascuti Filip - Tekmetric Frontend Interview

## About the project

The project is a weather application that allows users to search for any location using an autocomplete-enabled input. Upon selecting a location, users are presented with detailed weather information, including both hourly and weekly forecasts. Additionally, users can bookmark their favorite locations for quick access and view the current weather for their own geographic location.



## Get started - Set up locally

1. Go to the [weather api website](https://www.weatherapi.com/), create an account in order to get an API Key
2. Create a new file named `.env.local`
3. Create a new environment variable in the `.env.local` file named `VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY` and set it to the value of your API Key acquired at step 1:
```
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
4. Install the project dependencies using `yarn`
5. Now you can run the project using the `yarn start` command
6. _(optional)_ For running the tests use `yarn test`
